# Getting Started

SASEUL is a public blockchain network. Anyone who wants to join the network can establish oneâ€™s own SASEUL node. One can
mine resources, host dApps, browse the whole network data and do various interesting things with the SASEUL node.

<br>

# Specifications

### Minimum specs

* 2 Core CPU
* 8 GB RAM
* 256 GB SSD

### Recommended

* 4 Core+ CPU
* 32 GB+ RAM
* 1 TB+ SSD

<br>

# Preparation

## Port fowarding & Static IP

The SASEUL node uses 80 and 443 port of your router. You need to set your router to allow the SASEUL node instance to
use these ports.

* To see how to set the ports in AWS EC2, go
to [AWS EC2 Security group rules](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/security-group-rules.html)

## Install docker

Since the SASEUL main network is a minimal version that adopts some of the features of the SASEUL engine, 
even a light update can greatly change the source code. 
Therefore, for the convenience of operation, we have decided to provide nodes as Docker containers.

* Please check the [Docker official website](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/){:target="_blank"}
link for instructions on how to install Docker.

# Installation

## Quick Start

1. Install Docker on your PC or server.
2. Use the following command to download the latest version.
    ```shell
    $ docker pull artifriends/saseul-network:latest
    $ docker run -d --init --name saseul-node -p 80:80 artifriends/saseul-network:latest
    
    $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script SetEnv
    ...
    
    $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-install
    $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Start
    $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script StartMining 
    $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Info
    ```
3. If you encounter any issues, run the following command.
   ```shell
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Restart
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script StartMining
   ```
4. If block data synchronization is too slow, run the following command.
   ```shell
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Stop
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Reset
   
   ... reset ...
   
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script ForceSync --peer main.saseul.net
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Start
   $ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script Log
   ```

## If you want to change the folder to store block data

* If you follow this procedure, you will not have to synchronize every time you patch.

```shell
$ docker pull artifriends/saseul-network:latest

$ mkdir <Path to folder> # ex) mkdir /var/saseul-data
$ chown -Rf <user:group> <Path to folder> # ex) chown -Rf ec2-user:ec2-user /var/saseul-data

$ docker run -d --init --name saseul-node -p 80:80 \
-v /var/saseul-data:/var/saseul/saseul-network/data artifriends/saseul-network:latest
    

... The remaining procedures are the same as above. ...
```

## Backup node information.
```shell
$ docker exec -i saseul-node saseul-script GetEnv --all

... The displayed node environment information ...
```
