# Introduction

Thank you for visiting the SASEUL Mainnet documentation. 
This project was launched to demonstrate that the so-called 
“blockchain trilemma”—the difficulty of simultaneously achieving 
decentralization, scalability, and security—has indeed been resolved. 
SASEUL Mainnet maintains complete decentralization while offering high scalability and robust security, 
effectively dispelling any doubts about the feasibility of such a blockchain.

All of this has been made possible by the SASEUL Engine. 
By utilizing the SASEUL Engine, anyone can construct a network that overcomes the blockchain trilemma. 
SASEUL Mainnet stands as the first and most representative example of this achievement.

In addition, SL is a digital resource minted in proportion to each node’s contribution within SASEUL Mainnet. 
Network participants pay a certain amount of SL to propagate transactions, 
through which rewards and incentives for network operations are distributed.

In particular, this document explains how users can issue, transfer, 
and query SL based on the smart contracts deployed on SASEUL Mainnet. 
It also covers how transaction records and contribution data for each node are stored and verified. 
By exploring these details, readers will gain an understanding of the record structure 
and verification processes of the SASEUL Mainnet, as well as how to effectively utilize SL.

Finally, the document provides systematic guidance on building a fully decentralized blockchain environment 
by integrating the SASEUL Engine with SASEUL Mainnet. 
We hope this material serves as a valuable reference for anyone interested in implementing or examining SASEUL Mainnet.

The SL logic is implemented as a Smart Contract. The details and base code are available at:
- [Block Explorer (SL Contracts)](https://explorer.saseul.com/?ic=ctm&h=19bd191ea2da3fd599528b4b831206ec5cf958d6cdbea0188a22d7d44673dd58&ia=list)
- [SASEUL Github (Sample Contracts)](https://github.com/saseul/sample-contracts/tree/master/system/sl)


### Basic SL Design

- Network participants refine their contribution points into SL.
- Every time they serve as a validator, they earn at least 2,000 contribution points.
- The SL obtained through refining decreases by 27/32 at specific intervals (about every four years).
- SL supports 18 decimal places; handle amounts as strings (e.g., "1000000000000000000" for 1 SL).
- Fees (paid in SL) are reconverted into a Resource and rewarded to validators.
